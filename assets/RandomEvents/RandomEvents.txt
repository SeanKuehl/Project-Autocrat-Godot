Charter of Rights and Plebs

You have had the amazing idea to guarantee certain basic rights to all
of your people. They will be forever grateful, but your family will not be.
Add 2000 to your rebellion threshold but your family will now revolt 10
approval sooner due to this action. All family approvals will be returned to
zero due while they seethe at your genius.

An individual has come forward claiming to be your long lost child
(you know, from your wild and frisky days). They say if they are allowed
to be your hier they will not ask for money or anything like that ever.
All they ask is the right to slaughter any current family. If you accept
this offer you will be international enemy number one and wars will cost 50% more per turn.

Foriegn Favour

A foriegn ruler is asking you for a favour. They admire your security
and would like to borrow some of it in exchange for valuable commodities such
as food, materials and collectable trading cards. It will cost you 50% of your
current security points, but the cost to hold a celebration will be reduced by
10 times! Think of what you could do with all of those trading cards...

Forced Conscription

Taxation without representation, no rights, brutal forced labour. 
Who's allowing these plebs to get away with such luxury? Force 
conscription on the lower classes to make them earn their existence!
This will lower the cost of wars by 50% per turn but will reduce
the rebellion points needed for a revolt by 1000.
