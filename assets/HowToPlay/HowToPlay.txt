Hello and welcome ruler to your new nation. In order to stay in power you need to keep the people in check.
The main way you keep the people in check is with Castes. In order to make a caste you'll need to select
who should belong to it and what rights they should have as well as if they are a ruling caste or lower
caste.

A Selection determines who is in the caste. If you don't select anyone all groups will be included.
The pickier you are, the less people will be in the caste. If the caste is a ruling caste, it will
not pay taxes but the larger it's population the more security points it will generate. If it's a 
lower caste the larger it's population the more taxes it generates but also more rebellion points.

Rights determine what the group of people belonging to the caste can and can't do in your nation.
This also determines their approval of you. Your ruling class should have a higher approval of you
than the lower classes. If the ruling class has more than 20 approval, it will generate security points
and if a lower class has less than -20 approval it will generate rebellion points.

Security Points are needed to fight wars and take actions to keep your nation safe. Rebellion points
are a culmination of the unrest of the lower classes. If they get too high, there will be a rebellion
and you'll be overthrown. Economy points are essentially money that can be used appease the lower classes
or feed the thirst of entitled family members.

You can start a war at anytime. Each turn you are at war you will up more and more security points.
If you surrender a war you will gain rebellion points and lose economy points. If you win a war
you will erase all rebellion points and win lots of economy points. Sometimes, it's a risk worth
taking. The biggest problem is that you never know how long a war could drag on for.
After all is said and done it's only your people's lives, what's there to lose?

Family is great, at being corrupt. Even though no one could ever be as great as you, no one rules
forever. Sooner or later you will need an heir. To do this you will need a spouse and children.
Each of these family members will have three traits. Some good and some bad. Sometimes they will
make ruling easier and sometimes they'll throw a tantrum if they can't buy new designer shoes.
Either way, it's a risk you'll have to take. Be careful about any family member's approval getting
too low, they may try and overthrow you!
